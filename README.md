Thread: SpineDAO & the Future of Healthcare DePIN 

1/ SpineDAO is revolutionizing spine care for 600M+ people with spinal diseases using DePIN! By combining blockchain, AI, & community-driven innovation, it’s building a decentralized ecosystem for better diagnosis, treatment, & recovery. #SpineDAO #DePIN #Healthcare 

2/ What’s DePIN? It’s a blockchain-powered network where communities manage physical infrastructure. SpineDAO uses this to create AI tools like FILTER & DeScide, optimizing patient triage & surgical decisions while rewarding contributors with $SPINE tokens. #AI #Blockchain 


3/ SpineDAO’s FILTER tool uses AI to streamline patient triage, reducing delays for surgical candidates. Built on Solana, it ensures transparency & efficiency, saving billions in healthcare costs. The future of spine care is here! #Solana #HealthTech 

4/ With $SPINE tokens, patients, doctors, & researchers collaborate equitably. Share data, validate insights, & build the world’s largest decentralized spine research library—all while maintaining privacy & compliance. #Decentralized #SpineCare 

5/ SpineDAO’s TraCker leverages IoT & AI for real-time post-op monitoring, cutting readmissions & costs. DePIN makes this possible by decentralizing data & rewarding contributors, creating a fair, transparent system. #IoT #HealthcareInnovation 

6/ Why DePIN for healthcare? It’s democratic, secure, & efficient. SpineDAO’s model shifts power from corporations to communities, ensuring ethical data use & better outcomes. Join the movement to transform spine care! #DePIN #SpineDAO 

7/ SpineDAO raised $827,500 to fuel AI-driven research & launched $SPINE on Solana. With 120+ spine surgeons & scientists, it’s setting a benchmark for decentralized healthcare. The future is transparent, ethical, & patient-centered! #Web3 #Health 

8/ Want to shape the future of spine care? Join SpineDAO’s community, use $SPINE tokens, & contribute to a decentralized health ecosystem. Together, we can make advanced treatments accessible to all! ￼ #JoinSpineDAO #DeSci
